# E-commerce Website
This is a virtual `E-commerce Website` developed using the Django web
framework, Python, and SQLite. It includes the core functionality and
features needed to support online sales and customer management, as well
as a basic design and user interface.
It provides an online shopper with a list of the various products available
for purchase in the store. To make online shopping easier, a shopping cart
is available for users to add items to as they browse. Once the desired
goods have been selected, the user can proceed to the order confirmation
process

## Usage
To use the website, simply browse the product catalog and add items to your
shopping cart. When you are ready to checkout, you can initiate the process
and wait for confirmation from an administrator. You can also create a
customer account to manage your orders and personal information.
